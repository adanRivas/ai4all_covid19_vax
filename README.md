# AI4All Project Team 1-Covid-19 Vaccination Adoption Rates
This code base houses regressions model used to predict vaccine adoptions rates in the U.S. and compare them to that of Portugal to better understand what direction the United States is heading in terms of vaccine adoption.

## Background
This project was developed for the ApplyAI program to apply various Machine Learning techniques learned to a topic of interest. Since COVID-19 is a present concern in the world we live in, this project looks at attempting to predict when the United States will reach a vaccine adoption rate of 90% since, as of November 21,2021, only about 58.5% of the U.S. population is currently fully vaccinated. By fully vaccinated, we mean that the individual has received a full dosage of the vaccine they had administered. We compare this data to Portugal which has almost reached 90% of vaccination (fully vaccinated & partly vaccinated) and use this to analyze what Portugal has done to reach such a high vaccination adoption rate and ways that the U.S. can keep increasing vaccination adoption rates.

## Results
We found that applying a linear regression model to our data was not the best fit since at the beginning we have a curved growth rate since the amount of people getting vaccinated per month would not be constant. Although it was not the best fit for our data, we were able to note a general trend with the linear regression model, being that overall the U.S. has an increase in the population being fully vaccinated. 

## Next Steps in this Project
The next steps would be to continue to tweak our project and models to obtain a better prediction. We are thinking of exploring different models such as using logistic regression or polynomial regression.
